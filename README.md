Wanna use this and dont know how to code? maybe first learn to read code, and here you have a full repository that you would like to know about. open-source as should be. im self-taught. and I think the fact
that open-source is such a big communal thing, I learned to understand the code way before i had a computer to type my ideas out. I was young and have not had any interest in doing coding as my "IT" job. I wanna teach and show that coding is fun. not just functional. Im not going to explain how to in the real sense, basically explains you the basics about how to start and install a few things on your computer. we have AI now. use them to guide you through it. also no lisence!? cuz why the fuck do i care. im just not responsible for dumbass idiots that abuse their way to the top. if you die because of me. its what god planned. dear judah. learn this idiot to sit down or gain. enough of yapping. advanced shit here. enjoy.
