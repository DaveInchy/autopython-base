## Current Problem: Inventory Click Detection Failure

We are currently stuck on correctly detecting clicks within the inventory. The `UIInteraction.get_inventory_slot_from_coords` method is consistently returning `None`, indicating that the click coordinates are not being correctly mapped to an inventory slot.

## Blocking Issue: Missing Debug Output

Debug print statements added to `get_inventory_slot_from_coords` in `src/ui_utils.py` are not appearing in the console, even with `sys.stdout.flush()`. This prevents us from seeing the intermediate coordinate calculations and diagnosing the problem.

## Next Steps for Diagnosis:

To resolve this, we need to gather more information about your specific setup and the coordinate data:

1.  **Provide `user-interface.jsonc` content:**
    Please provide the full content of your `scripts/src/data/user-interface.jsonc` file. This file defines the UI element coordinates, and we need to verify its structure and values.

2.  **Provide `client_rect` values:**
    When the script is running, please provide the output of `client.get_rect()`. You can temporarily add a `print(client.get_rect())` statement within the `process_gui_queue` function in `_ZulrahHelper.dev.py` (or another suitable place that executes frequently) to capture this. This will give us the absolute screen coordinates and dimensions of the RuneLite client window on your system.

3.  **Manual Coordinate Check:**
    With the above information, we can manually trace the coordinate calculations to identify the discrepancy between the click coordinates and the expected inventory region.

4.  **Alternative Debugging (if needed):**
    If console prints remain elusive, we might need to resort to writing debug information to a temporary file to bypass any stdout redirection or buffering issues.
