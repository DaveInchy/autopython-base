docs: Update ui_utils.py demo for comprehensive UI interaction showcase

Refactored the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `ui_utils.py` to provide a more interactive and comprehensive demonstration of UI interaction capabilities.

The updated demo:
- Allows users to choose between image-based and coordinate-based clicking.
- Showcases interaction with Inventory, Prayer, Magic (Standard and Ancient), and Equipment slots.
- Clearly indicates the interaction method used for each step.
- Guides users on creating necessary template images for image recognition.
