fix: Correct ui_utils.py import for demo execution

Corrected the import statement for `WindowOverlay` in `ui_utils.py` from an absolute to a relative import. This resolves `ModuleNotFoundError` when running `ui_utils.py` as a module within its package structure, enabling proper execution of the demo.
