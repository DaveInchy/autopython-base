feat: Enhance UI interaction with image recognition and dynamic sizing

This commit introduces significant improvements to UI interaction within the Zulrah script, offering greater flexibility and robustness.

Key changes include:
- **Hybrid UI Interaction**: Implemented an optional image recognition system for clicking UI elements (inventory, prayer, magic, equipment slots). Users can now toggle between image-based detection and the existing grid-based coordinate system via a new `use_image_recognition` setting.
- **Dynamic UI Sizing**: Integrated a mechanism to extract UI element dimensions from RuneLite resource packs. These dimensions are used to dynamically update `user-interface.jsonc`, ensuring more accurate grid-based calculations that adapt to different UI scales.
- **Improved `UIInteraction` Class**: The `UIInteraction` class in `ui_utils.py` was refactored to support both interaction methods, providing a more resilient and adaptable framework.
- **Dependency Update**: Added `Pillow` and `opencv-python` to `requirements.txt` to support image processing capabilities.

These changes aim to make the script more reliable and adaptable to various RuneLite client configurations, reducing reliance on static, hardcoded coordinates.
