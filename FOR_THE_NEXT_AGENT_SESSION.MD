# Session Summary: Zulrah Helper Enhancements & Coordinate System Overhaul

This session focused on improving the robustness and humanization of the Zulrah Helper script, with a significant effort dedicated to a dynamic coordinate transformation system for stretched mode clients.

## Key Features & Improvements:

*   **Prayer Management Overhaul:**
    *   Implemented internal state tracking for prayers (`SCRIPT['state']['prayer_state']`) to prevent accidental deactivation (double-clicking).
    *   Added new hotkeys: `a` for "Protect from Magic" and `s` for "Protect from Missiles".
    *   Script now automatically activates offensive magic prayer upon entering combat.
    *   Refactored prayer switching logic to use the new state-aware `toggle_prayer` function.

*   **Input Reliability & Humanization:**
    *   **'R' Hotkey Fix:** Corrected `manual_blood_blitz` to prevent accidental clicks on teleport items after casting a spell.
    *   **Mouse Jitter Feature (Implemented & Removed):**
        *   Initially implemented to simulate human hesitation during idle times.
        *   Caused significant issues (cumulative mouse offset, interference with clicks).
        *   **Completely removed** at user's request due to these problems, reverting to simple `time.sleep()` pauses.

*   **Dynamic Coordinate Transformation (Stretched Mode Overhaul):**
    *   **Goal:** Create a robust, percentage-based coordinate system for stretched RuneLite clients.
    *   **`CoordinateTransformer` Class:** Introduced to handle dynamic scaling of UI element coordinates.
    *   **Reference Dimensions:** Crucially, identified and corrected the `REF_CLIENT_WIDTH` (706) and `REF_CLIENT_HEIGHT` (528) constants in `CoordinateTransformer` to accurately represent the *drawable area* of a fixed-mode client, which is the correct baseline for scaling.
    *   **Scaling Logic:** Rewrote `transform_stretched_coords` to directly scale bottom-right relative coordinates from `user-interface.jsonc` based on the ratio of the live client's drawable area to these corrected reference dimensions.
    *   **F-Key Reliability:** Ensured `on_low_health` and `on_low_prayer` functions explicitly press 'F2' to open the inventory tab before attempting clicks, making them self-contained and reliable.

*   **Debugging Tool (`UIGridDebugger.py`):**
    *   Created a dedicated script to visually verify the coordinate transformation system.
    *   **Fixed Multiple Bugs:**
        *   `SyntaxError: unmatched ')'` in `_ZulrahHelper.dev.py`.
        *   `KeyError: 'centerx'` in `ui_utils.py` (manual calculation of center).
        *   `AttributeError: 'WindowOverlay' object has no attribute 'draw_crosshair'` (replaced with `draw_rectangle` for crosshairs).
        *   `OSError` (invalid escape sequence in image path for compass template).
    *   Adjusted debugger FPS to 10 for better performance.
    *   Updated debugger to reflect changes in `CoordinateTransformer` (drawing `client_rect` as the scaling basis).

## Current Status:

*   The coordinate transformation system for stretched mode should now be accurately aligned.
*   Prayer management is state-aware.
*   Mouse jitter feature has been removed.
*   Debugger is currently running for verification.
