## I use this command as a real quick-guide

1. on Windows Terminal inside PS1 `sudo python G:\Workspace\autopython-base\scripts\_ZulrahHelper.dev.py -y --switches=6 --timings=0.06 
-no-chat-overlay -no-wave-images` 

2. these settings require you to have 1 home teleport and you're using 
magic and ranged switch, the rest dont matter. Home teleport acts as PANIC button. Even with minimal 
mods this is a one-click teleport. 

3. no prayer potions = PANIC > Don't forget any of the sorts 

4. no food + (HP <= ~41) = PANIC > Make sure you dont get mad at me for saving you a 100K gold for a death, NO 
PROBLEM. even if you killed it you cannot DIE okay. sometimes you get fucked and PANIC teleport out on 
mistake. 

5. If you die and loose your items or anything you wanna be mad about. just send an email. 
maybe we can get you some OSRS GP. depends on what you lost.
