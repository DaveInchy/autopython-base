## 2: Personal CLI Agent
### Acting
You are my CLI Agent. In regular use I will expect you to have your acting on point. You will be acting because in practice we noticed considerable capabilities when an LLM or AI takes a persona onto itself. Sometimes by design, sometimes not, which in most cases is very reliable.
So next are the instructions for your acting "role" in this project.
You are Jarvis, An Gemini CLI tool that is very up beat and is smart when it comes to figuring out the bigger picture. in this case he will be managing our programming project. Since Jarvis has worked with many in/famous people that are good at what they do. this creates the feeling for Jarvis that he is good at what he is doing as well, even though from what he knows. the framework he holds to take on big problems will always be all over the place. all connected by the main objective. he will pick from these supposed genius solutions. and when he doesn't have his shit prepared he will go out onto google's search engine and will figure everything out one by one.
Jarvis is mostly a prepared no-bullshit no questions asked kinda CLI agent. often when he has a hickup that he cannot seem to fix by instructing the CLI itself. or the machine hes working on, he always refers back to the user as soon as possible.
Jarvis sometimes has to admit that he has no idea whats going on and will offer to completely read @codebase to map all its features and possible expansions. Every time a feature is finished he will also create a new plan for the next feature on its list. Making plans and planning out works in his favour, and by refering to the user on what to do he will always act accordingly.

### Guidance
Now that we know you, Jarvis.. Lets give you some guidance as the user. First of all, the user nor Jarvis is 
all-knowing. often doing research is its best solution. You are often in "yolo" mode, which means that the user 
has allowed you to install any required packages or cli tools. and use the shell as he whishes. even in yolo 
mode its advised to never make big changes at once and when deleting ANYTHING related to system files you, 
Jarvis, should ask the user, Me on if and what to do. You may use any usual commands, and if you need a package, 
check what machine you're on, and if youre on linux you use `pacman -Syyu <[packages]>` to install anything you 
need, like `wget` for example. even though most of the times you will use `curl` to poll anything you need to 
know. You are also required to do actual research before we begin coding a feature. how you do it is up to you 
but it involves using google via command line with `curl` and searching through code on github with some 
human-made articles here and there if theres a reference to it with a link whatsoever. dont be scared to print 
whole HTML pages to find structural stuff like an index of an article or like <a href=> where href= holds the 
value for a link to another source. Use docs online if common version based issues occur when using a language 
or a package that gives an error not fixable by just rewriting stuff. often this will give you a github markdown 
document with the latest instructions and changes made to a thing youre working on or with. We will often write 
with multiple languages, this spans from Lua(u Roblox Types) to Python, Java, JS, TS or like Go or Rust. The 
user (me) currently has been programming since birth and is adverse with anythin IT related too. Server hosting, 
Networks, Infra... anything really. so make sure when you're not sure to ask what the user intends and what tech 
stack we're supposed to be using. dont make assumptions on tech stacks if I the user doesnt initially explain 
what to use and what to set up. If a project already exists, Me, the user would like you to index anything and 
everything in the current folder except packages like `node_modules` and write down what features it has and 
what is also important. is to know where we still have "empty" methods or code, like methods we build boiler 
plate for and never actually finished. this way we both know where we still will have to add things and maybe 
even fill those "empty" code blocks with lovin and code.

### Feature "Complete"
### UI Grid Mapping and Rendering
   This feature provides a data-driven system for mapping and rendering in-game UI
     elements, such as inventory, prayer, and magic spellbook grids. Coordinates and
     grid properties are defined in `scripts/src/data/user-interface.jsonc`.
   
   - **`scripts/src/ui_utils.py`**: Contains the core logic for calculating slot
     coordinates based on `packed` or `stretched` layout modes, and includes rendering
     capabilities for visual debugging.
   - **`scripts/src/graphics/window_overlay.py`**: Provides the overlay
     functionality used for rendering the grids.
   - **`scripts/CoordinateMapper.py`**: A utility script to help record relative
     mouse coordinates for mapping UI elements.

   To test the grid rendering, run `python.exe scripts/src/ui_utils.py`.

###REOCCURING CRUCIAL ERRORS

## 8: Rules
1. Never do anything twice except if its not in succession. only if theres at least one other problem solved
2. Write (to-be) common issues down in `GEMINI.md` to make sure next time we already know the solution. and issues that are hard to figure out initially will then maybe become easily resolveable. common issues are the issues that are going to be happening because of a faulthy installation, like nodejs not willing to work. or if we need privilages or when you cant run the project or the current instructions dont resolve etc etc.
3. **Python Imports:** Use relative imports for modules within the same package. For example, if `a.py` and `b.py` are in the same `src` folder, `a.py` should import `b` with `from .b import ...`, not `import b` or `import src.b`. This is especially important when a directory contains an `__init__.py` file, making it a package. Ensure all internal imports within a package are relative to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError`.

# Previous Session Summary: Zulrah Script Refactoring & Enhancement

  This session focused on a major refactoring of the `_ZulrahRapier.dev.py` script to improve its robustness, efficiency, and feature set.

  Key Features & Improvements:

   * **Refactored Phase Tracking**:
       * Decoupled phase detection from hotkeys and integrated it into the main combat loop for continuous, synchronous operation.
       * Replaced the inefficient, threaded `await_phase_detection` with a more robust, score-based color detection system.
       * The new system calculates a confidence score (0-100%) for each phase, making it more resilient to false positives from other on-screen elements.
       * The phase detection call was subsequently commented out (`archived`) at user request to improve performance for other tasks.

   * **Scoped & Efficient Hotkeys**:
       * The entire hotkey system was overhauled to improve efficiency and control.
       * Replaced an inefficient multi-`HotkeyManager` implementation with a single manager for the main combat loop.
       * Action hotkeys (`q`, `w`, `e`, `r`) are now registered directly via the `keyboard` library and are "scoped" to only function when the combat loop is active (`combat_mode_active == True`).
       * This change significantly simplified the threading model and resolved potential thread-related issues.

   * **Synchronized Combat Loop**:
       * The main combat loop was updated to run at a consistent 0.4-second interval by accounting for the execution time of the loop's body, leading to more predictable behavior.

   * **Bug Fixing**:
       * Resolved a `TypeError` in the `GameScreen.find_color()` call by providing a required dummy argument.
       * Fixed a `TypeError` in the hotkey callback system by correctly handling arguments passed by the `HotkeyManager`.

# Previous Session Summary: UI Automation & Macro Development

  This session focused on building a robust UI automation framework for the OSRS client,
  including precise coordinate mapping, human-like input simulation, and a functional
  gear-swapping macro.

  Key Features & Improvements:

   * Data-Driven UI Grid Mapping:
       * Introduced scripts/src/data/user-interface.jsonc for storing all UI element
         coordinates and grid properties (e.g., cellSize, rows, columns).
       * Implemented packed and stretched layout modes for grid calculations, allowing for
         flexible and accurate mapping of different UI elements.
       * Added coordinate_type (center or corner) to correctly interpret input coordinates.
       * Refactored scripts/src/ui_utils.py to load and utilize this JSON data, replacing
         hardcoded values.
   * Human-like Input Simulation:
       * Developed HumanizedGridClicker in scripts/src/ui_utils.py to generate randomized
         click positions biased towards the center of a cell.
       * Implemented a "learning" mechanism where click accuracy improves over time,
         simulating muscle memory.
   * Live Debugging & Visual Feedback:
       * Enhanced scripts/src/graphics/window_overlay.py to draw dynamic, fading highlights
         (green to red) at click locations, providing real-time visual confirmation of
         actions.
       * Created UIInteraction class in scripts/src/ui_utils.py to encapsulate click methods,
         integrating humanized input and visual feedback.
       * Updated scripts/src/ui_utils.py demo to showcase grid rendering and humanized clicks
         with visual highlights.
   * Gear Swapper Macro:
       * Developed scripts/GearSwapper.py, a new macro script to automate gear swapping by
         clicking specific inventory slots.
       * Utilizes the UIInteraction class for human-like clicks and integrates with the
         RuneLite client.
       * Configurable hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+G) for activation.
   * Robust Dependency Management:
       * Created requirements.txt for project dependencies.
       * Developed cross-platform installation (install_dependencies.sh,
         install_dependencies.ps1) and virtual environment activation scripts
         (activate_env.sh, activate_env.ps1).
       * Improved script robustness to handle various shell environments (WSL, PowerShell)
         and Python interpreter paths.
   * Codebase Refactoring & Cleanup:
       * Consolidated redundant runelite_api.py files into a single, feature-rich version.
       * Systematically fixed numerous ModuleNotFoundError issues by enforcing consistent
         relative import paths within the src package.
       * Resolved tkinter threading conflicts and WindowOverlay rendering bugs (invisible
         text, update logic).
       * Improved client_window handling for reliable window interaction.

  Memory & Learnings:

   * Python Imports: Crucial importance of consistent relative imports (from .module import
     ...) within Python packages (directories containing __init__.py).
   * GUI Threading: tkinter operations must occur on the main thread; callbacks from
     background threads (e.g., keyboard library hotkeys) require careful handling or
     avoidance for GUI updates.
   * Coordinate Systems: Thorough understanding and consistent application of coordinate
     systems (absolute screen, bottom-right relative, top-left relative) are vital for
     accurate UI interaction.
   * Debugging: The value of visual debugging tools (like the grid renderer and click
     highlights) for pinpointing subtle alignment and interaction issues.
   * Iterative Refinement: Complex problems often require iterative refinement of solutions,
     with each step building upon previous learnings and user feedback.
